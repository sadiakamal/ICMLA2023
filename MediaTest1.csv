  nationalism always lead to defeat    macron say    if courage be lack in the defense of fundamental principle international order become fragile and this can lead as we have already see twice to global war we see that with our very own eye  
 while trump s address have be greet with a mix of giggle murmur long period of silence and with polite applause at the end the french president s speech be give a rapturous reception trump be chair the meeting because the we currently hold the rotate presidency of the security council the original plan be to devote the session to iran to allow trump to highlight iran s role in the syrian and yemeni conflict its missile development and the full range of what washington call tehran s malign activity however the administration come to fear that would also highlight the transatlantic rift over the iran nuclear deal from which trump withdraw in may as his fellow leader be equally determined to speak in defence of the agreement the iranian president hassan rouhani would also have have a right to attend and to speak in a session exclusively about his country the subject of wednesday s session have therefore be widen to counterproliferation include north korea but iran be still likely to be a central point of contention the trump administration have set out its campaign against iran at the un general assembly produce a special booklet outlaw regime chronicle iran s destructive activity

  we will use every tool available to pursue soleimani and other like he    bolton say    iran s leadership will no long enjoy a life of security and luxury while their people suffer and starve  
 bolton stress that the campaign against soleimani would focus on funding and arm supply but ask ask for clarification later the us envoy on iran and the head of the state department iran action group brian hook do not rule out military action ask what bolton mean by use every available tool against soleimani hook say    I think it speak for itself  
  so look at iraq with soleimani the irgc be responsible for so much violence and bloodshed in the middle east and as part of restore our deterrence we will be focus on he and his operation    hook say in his own remark to the uani conference the secretary of state mike pompeo say that an iranianbacked militia be responsible for rocket attack against the us embassy compound in baghdad and the us consulate in basra in southern iraq he warn that the we would response directly against iran in the event of another such attack from iran or a militia deem to be an iranian proxy

  the wake up call for most of we come when gabbard meet with trump soon after his inauguration and then with assad instead of march on dc with we and the rest of the hawaii s congressional delegation during the woman s march in protest of what have become an unprecedented abolition of human and civil right in america    say sherry alu campagna an environmental scientist who be among gabbard s most wellknown primary challenger the wake up call for most of we come when gabbard meet with trump soon after his inauguration 
  the incumbent clearly have an agenda that do not involve her constituent and we be wake up to the fact that our need be take a back seat to her ambition  
 gabbard have emerge in recent year as a paradox of the progressive movement when she be first elect to congress msnbc host rachel maddow declare at the time    she be on the fast track to be very famous  
 indeed gabbard swiftly cement herself as one to watch she cofounde the congressional future caucus bring together the young member of congress with an eye on address issue face millennial and land assignment on the house committee on foreign affair and armed service in the 2016 election cycle gabbard seize on an opportunity to further her rise to national prominence at the height of the hotly contest democratic presidential primary gabbard resign from her position as the vicechair of the democratic national committee and endorse the insurgent candidate bernie sanders gabbard s move come as democrats struggle to rein in an intraparty feud stem from allegation that the dnc be work behind the scene to influence the nominating contest in hillary clinton s favor two year later gabbard s support for sander have pay dividend her reelection bid draw the endorsement of our revolution a grassroots political organization launch by veteran of sander campaign 
  she have be an ardent supporter of many of the issue in our people s platform medicare for all transition to clean renewable energy criminal justice reform and make wall street pay their fair share    the group say in a statement when ask about gabbard s meeting with assad the group dub gabbard as a passionate advocate for peace and diplomacy which often require meeting with people whose action we do not agree with  
 but gabbard s critic argue her view on foreign policy immigration and gun law warrant more scrutiny and undermine the agenda upon which democrats be campaign across the country 
  nationally people think she check all the box this be great    say shay chan hodge an activist who unsuccessfully challenge gabbard in 2016    but I think people have now start look more closely at her record and what she s say  
 gabbard s opponent have cite her refusal to debate they as evidence of her reticence to publicly defend her record on certain hotbutton issue gabbard be unchallenged in 2014 and have not take part in a primary debate since the year she be elect hawaii news now attempt to convene a debate between campagna and gabbard to no avail the congresswoman s campaign defend the move by state    she continue to communicate directly with voter across the district  
 it be not uncommon for dominant incumbent to generally avoid debate but gabbard s decision to decline to participate in such a forum have expose she to charge of hypocrisy since she forcefully advocate for add more debate between clinton and sander in 2016 in a highprofile split from other dnc leader 
  while she may think this be a strategic move to prevent the success of her challenger what it really do be silence the discussion of important issue that face hawaii s rural constituent    say campagna    it also prevent any opportunity for voter to hold tulsi accountable  
 in 2015 gabbard be among a minority of democrats who vote for additional restriction on refugee enter the we from syria and iraq she have also previously express skepticism that the assad regime be behind chemical weapon attack in syria and align herself with nationalist figure such as narendra modi of india break with most democrats gabbard have embrace the use of the phrase radical islam    a phrase which to many muslims have evolve into a dog whistle on the right intend to indict the entire islamic faith gabbard have say she be mindful that most muslim be not extremist but join republicans in criticize clinton and barack obama for not employ the phrase state    it s important that you identify your enemy  
  congresswoman tulsi gabbard have speak out strongly against the trump administration s travelrefugee ban the trump administration s illegal military strike against syria trump s decision to pull out of the iran nuclear deal trump s decision to end daca and other dangerous decision and policy    erika tsuji a spokeswoman for gabbard s reelection campaign say in a statement to  
 gabbard also stand by her meeting with assad her spokeswoman say    she have state time and again that peace can never be achieve if we only meet and speak with our friend if we really want peace we need to be fearless enough to sit down and speak directly with our adversary  
 although a majority of democratic voter in gabbard s district and neighboring area say she be obligate to debate her rival the snub have not appear to have have much palpable effect on her prospect colin moore an associate professor of political science at the university of hawaii say gabbard s continued popularity be undeniable but whereas he predict gabbard would sail to another term in congress moore say she have yet to truly be test nationally where her ambition may in fact be 
  the hawaii congressional delegation have often think of itself as a team whose primary goal be to go to washington and bring federal dollar back to hawaii    moore say    the way they have do that be work with everyone keep a very low profile be around for a very long time and rise in seniority  
  tulsi have really buck that trend she be this national political figure who appear on cnn and other national medium outlet quite frequently talk about issue that don t directly affect hawaii  
  that have lead to a sense that she s neglect her responsibility and that she isn t really serve her constituent well    he add it be reveal in june that gabbard be write a book to be publish by a literary agency that boast of represent presidential contender last october she travel on a multiday swing through the caucus state of iowa urge party unity while fuel speculation of high ambition although her opponent be far from likely to pull off an upset this cycle the brim frustration that gabbard be take her position for grant and skepticism around her progressive image could foreshadow the challenge that lie ahead",theguardian,0

  the reality be that the saudis couldn t simply buy their weapon somewhere else    engel say in a statement    it would take year for the saudi military to reequip with russian or chinese weapon

  do republican really care less about the person at the bottom of the ladder than democrat do to be painfully honest I would have to say in some way yes     santorum write in his book    blue collar conservative recommit to an america that work  
 the tough talk raise question about santorum s viability in what could be a crowded 2016 primary field also he s not rush to camp out in early nominate iowa or new hampshire again 
  a while a year at least probably    he say of his timeline to decide on a 2016 bid santorum run an upstart campaign in 2012 survive long enough to be mitt romney s last remain rival he struggle to raise money or support among establishmentminde republicans but his socially conservative profile draw enough backing for santorum to pick up victory in 11 state even in victory his disorganized campaign cost he include fail to qualify for the ballot in virginia 
  we can not run the campaign we run last time if we run this time    santorum say how republicans win be the focus of santorum s late book to be release monday santorum offer idea on energy education the economy and health care it come across as part think tank policy paper part campaign playbook and part communications advice on how to connect with workingclass voter for instance republican should not focus exclusively on business leader and job creator and should speak to employee santorum say anxiety among those voter remain high and republicans have for too long talk to the top earner and not the worker

 that s why he argue candidate need to put forward policy to help those voter

  when there be no ceiling the sky s the limit    she acknowledge briefly before eventually the ceiling seem to fall in cover the floor of philadelphia s wells fargo arena in a carpet of red white and blue balloon so thick the candidate almost disappear from view hillary clinton accept the democratic nomination for president read the full transcript read more by the end of an hourlong acceptance speech there be child on stage some of they daughter smuggle in by father to witness an undoubted leap forward along the long road to equality in america clinton herself dwell little on the symbolism of her acceptance speech save for a cry of deal I in    which be take up lustily by the crowd instead she go straight to her first big exposition of what she would do if she actually win in november include a job program and investment in infrastructure 
  to drive real progress you have to change both heart and law    she say in clear contrast to the idealistic promise of her primary opponent bernie sander and the bigtalke republican enemy donald trump the us clinton say be at a moment of reckon as she call on voter to reject trump s divisive rhetoric and policy    powerful force be threaten to pull we apart bond of trust and respect be fray    she say but it be also a moment to turn slowly away from barack obama a man who only a day before have help the campaign reclaim the mantle of patriotism from trump now it be time for clinton to do the same with the economy 
  democrats we be the party of work people but we haven t do a good enough job show that we get what you re go through and that we re go to do something about it    she say 
  there s a lot to do    acknowledge clinton a departure from the campaign s recent insistence that trump be exaggerate the pain feel by work family    too many people haven t have a pay raise since the crash  
 she add    some of you be frustrate even furious and you know what you re right  
 to the confusion of a diehard band of bernie sander supporter in luminous tshirt who seek to disrupt the speech they be force instead to pause and even once or twice applaud when clinton present an unashamedly liberal and populist vision of america 
  if you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deal that we should stand up to china that we should support our steelworker and autoworker and homegrown manufacturer join we    say clinton in clear appeal to both right and leave incarnation of the pitchfork outbreak sweep the country in this election cycle 
  whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these belief this be your campaign    she add promise she would be a president for all americans whether they vote for she or not but take trump s appeal seriously be not the same as take trump seriously an increasingly confident clinton be merciless in skewer the celebrity billionaire as a little man  
  really    I alone can fix it     she ask at one point let the question hang there as a description of everything that be absurd about this closefought election race 
  he speak for 70odd minute and I do mean odd    she continue elicit the kind of laughter that be bind to produce a reaction from the man himself and do 
  imagine he if you dare imagine he in the oval office face a real crisis a man you can bait with a tweet be not a man we can trust with nuclear weapon    anticipate clinton he might be a joke she say but his appeal be not    for the past year many people make the mistake of laugh off donald trump s comment excuse he as an entertainer just put on a show    warn the former secretary of state    here s the sad truth there be no other donald trump this be it  
 the laugh come naturally for a crowd that warm to a rare display of comic timing from clinton    donald trump say he want to make america great again well he could start by actually make thing in america again  
 there be a little shake of the head as if to say duh when she say    I believe in science    and reject the denial of climate change in another year of temperature record smash she turn to another first lady jackie kennedy for the insult that may yet stick    she say that what worry president kennedy during that very dangerous time be that a war might be start not by big man with selfcontrol and restraint but by little man the one move by fear and pride  
 over the course of the evening trump be call many name    a political pyromaniac    say los angeles mayor eric garcetti who suggest trump should build his wall around the whole city 
  hillary clinton know how to fight back against dangerous loudmouth bully she doesn t run to twitter to give people badmouth nickname    say elizabeth warren who have be on the receiving end some of clinton s own putdown would end another campaign overnight but this be a teflon don seemingly able to say anything without consequence so clinton refuse the temptation to indulge in excessive trumpbashing prefer to paint her own vision there be plenty of policy a bold promise to introduce the big job program since the second world war in her first 100 day as president and invest money in infrastructure project and political capital in gun control reject the dangerously persistent notion that she simply want to be president because it be her turn clinton also use much of the pack speech to describe her real motivation introduce by her daughter chelsea she continue the week s highly personal theme by pin this political philosophy on her own mother dorothy 
  she make sure I learn the word of our methodist faith    say the nominee    do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the way you can as long as ever you can  
 the moral vision continue to help defuse the still simmer revolt on the left where a rump of sander supporter be largely drown out in their attempt to disrupt the night 
  I want to thank bernie sanders    say clinton    bernie your campaign inspire million of americans particularly the young people who throw their heart and soul into our primary  
 mostly she ignore disruption that be more noticeable in the hall than on television by the end the chant be no long paper over the crack in the party but rolling expression of real enthusiasm wave up and down the stadium the crowd have be fire up early in the evening by another speech that could easily have be at home in a sander rally    we be be call upon by our foremother and father to be the moral defibrillator    say rev william barber    we can not give up on the heart of democracy not now not ever we need to fight for the heart of this nation  
 but it be the calm nobility of khizr khan whose son die serve the us military in iraq who sum up why clinton be really run accuse trump of smear the character of patriotic american muslims 
  donald trump let I ask you have you even read the us constitution I will gladly lend you my copy look for the word liberty and equal protection under the law     say khan instead clinton make clear she would be a president for democrats republicans and independent  
  for the struggle the strive the successful for those who vote for I and those who don t whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these belief this be your campaign for all americans    she say appeal to those reagan democrats of a different age clinton say of trump    he s take the republican party a long way from morning in america to midnight in america  
  he want we to fear the future and fear each other well a great democratic president franklin delano roosevelt come up with the perfect rebuke to trump more than 80 year ago during a much more perilous time    the only thing we have to fear be fear itself   ",theguardian,0

 the government would ultimately have to destroy all call detail record produce under the order as prescribe by such procedure  
 a previous version of that language task the government merely with destroy call record not later than five year after the production of such record except for record that be relevant to an authorised investigation  
 while several privacy protection within the usa freedom act have be dilute in recent week several people familiar with the negotiation say they think the new provision well protect privacy than the old one as it represent the first know restriction on the nsa s corporate store of analyse datum the corporate store be the digital warehouse where the nsa store all the us call record it have amass when search for connection to the target phone number it believe may be tie to specific terrorist group until this year datum up to three hop from such a phone number be fit for inclusion in the store once datum be place in the store nsa analyst face virtually no restriction on their ability to search through it 
  nsa may apply the full range of sigint signal intelligence analytic tradecraft to phone record place in the store accord to a footnote in a fisa court order declassify by the government last year search through datum place in the corporate store can occur without the requirement that reasonable articulable suspicion of connection to wrongdoing exist nor be the nsa require to keep an auditable record of search perform within the corporate store the amount of datum contain within the corporate store be voluminous a january report from the us government s civil liberty watchdog estimate that the 300 search of americans phone datum the nsa say it perform in 2012 would yield record involve over 120 m phone number in that year alone the watchdog the privacy and civil liberty oversight board recommend that the nsa have to possess the same reasonable articulable suspicion to search datum in the corporate store as it must to analyse phone record once collect until now the usa freedom act increasingly the consensus bill for surveillance reform leave the corporate store alone under the bill the government would no long collect call record in bulk but it would be permit to acquire americans phone datum when a judge certify that there be reasonable articulable suspicion of a connection to terrorism or foreign espionage and it can collect phone record from the contact of the contact two hop    of the original person or phone account the government target the new language would apparently restrict the nsa from retain datum on the contact of the target not believe to have a connection to foreign intelligence information what surveillance observer sometimes refer to as the pizza guy problem where the nsa amass datum on random and irrelevant people or account connect to target but the language do not define key term such as how long a record can be withhold before its prompt destruction nor do it specify how the government will determine a call record be unrelated to foreign intelligence information if as can occur with the corporate store today nsa s automated program sift through the datum

 but the version that will head to the floor at the obama administration s insistence have broaden the definition open the door to broad datum collection than the bill s architect s initially envision the bill now define a specific selection term as a discrete term such as a term specifically identify a person entity account or device use by the government to limit the scope of the information or tangible thing seek

coordinate indicate where carpenter have be at the beginning and end of each of those call importantly it turn over these record even though the government have not obtain a warrant base on probable cause carpenter ask the court to suppress the government s evidence under the fourth amendment which protect the right to privacy many cellphone user have only a vague understanding of the extent to

which the connect phone s signal be receive and often the distance of the phone from the cell site socalle cell site location information be become ever more precise because the cellular network be become ever more dense the analytical tool that can be bring to bear on this information be also become more sophisticated meaning that investigator can draw reliable conclusion from small and small

of the press observe in its own brief file in the carpenter case cell site location information can reveal the story a journalist be work on before they be publish where a journalist go to gather information for those story and the identity of a journalist s source  
 this be why it be a mistake to think about the carpenter case solely through the lens of individual privacy a defeat for carpenter would be a defeat for privacy right but it would also mean a dramatic curtailment of first amendment freedom the carpenter case be the late in a series of case that have require the supreme court to consider the relevance of analogera precedent to digitalage technology although these case be present to the court as fourth amendment case the court be attentive to the implication of government surveillance for first amendment freedom when the court hold that the fourth amendment preclude the government from instal a gps device on a criminal suspect s car without first obtain a warrant five justice cite some of the same concern raise by the technologist we represent in carpenter do people reasonably expect that their movement will be record and aggregate in a manner that enable the government to ascertain more or less at will their political and religious belief and sexual habit    justice sonia sotomayor ask in her powerful concurrence two year later when the court rule that the government could not search a criminal suspect s cellphone without first obtain a warrant the court cite similar concern facial recognition be here the iphone x be just the beginning clare garvie read more

 the measure these state have introduce affect million of americans be design to suppress the vote hence the term voter suppression  
 such policy not only endanger the gain of the civil rights era which usher in the voting right act but they also threaten the notion that the united states be at the forefront of western liberal democracy in an interview last year barack obama say    we re the only advanced democracy that deliberately discourage people from vote

  in 2016 pummel by voter suppression in more than 30 state the black voter turnout plummet by seven percentage point for the gop that be an effective kill rate for america it be a lethal assault on democracy  
 this be why today be launch the fight to vote a yearlong investigation of the american democratic process and its failure it will scrutinize compromise electoral system give a platform to voice silence at the poll and reveal how voting suppression be already shape the 2020 election the struggle for the right to vote in the us have exist as long as the country itself in 1789 after the ratification of the constitution suffrage be extend only to white propertyowne man follow the abolition of slavery in the 19th century black people be permit to vote but after a brief period when black politician begin to win election the white majority begin to institute restriction like those that motivated king s march from selma international comparison show how voting restriction be a stain on we democracy in australia voting be compulsory in sweden all voter be automatically register both nation rank high on an electoral integrity index produce by academic at harvard university and the university of sydney yet rather than be rank with other major western democracy the us fall lower down the list alongside country like kosovo and romania international spectrum guardian graphic source the perception of electoral integrity expert survey countrylevel pei 70 of particular concern in the us say sarah repucci senior director at freedom house a thinktank in washington dc    be the technique that target minority mostly black voter institute by republicancontrolled state government country that have target minority voter include cameroon kosovo hardly regime that americans would consider to be our peer  
 it s no surprise that the us trail behind other democracy in voter turnout about 55 of eligible americans vote in the 2016 election compare with around 87 in belgium and 78 in south korea at every stage of the voting process americans face hurdle determine by where they live election law be set by partisan state lawmaker and administer in most place by secretary of state who be partisan official in several republicanleaning state the difficulty voter face start with the document they be require to produce in order to exercise their democratic right legislator across the country have tighten the requirement for acceptable form of identification this in a country where 7 of americans do not have photo ids and the number be high among black and hispanic population it s no surprise that the us trail behind other democracy in voter turnoutabout 55 of eligible americans vote in the 2016 election in 2016 wisconsin reinstate strict voter i d law ostensibly to fight voter fraud which expert have repeatedly find to be almost nonexistent for this reason in the runup to the presidential election a woman name anita johnson traverse three county in the southeast of the state she be part of an entire industry of activist try to get people to the poll when johnson who be an attorney and work with the notforprofit voterider make her way through the majority black community in town such as racine and kenosha she battle rumor and confusion about what form of i d people need to vote she accompany they to various government office to get a driver s license or help they find the old address record that they need to register it become clear to she that wisconsin s policy be discourage wouldbe voter 
  I ve do this all year since the 2018 election the thing be to not stop    she say    there be go to be a lot of confusion during the 2020 election because not everyone pay attention to democracy like I do  
 and not everyone in the state have an activist like johnson to help they when donald trump eventually win wisconsin with a 22000vote lead political analyst find that in the city of milwaukee alone there be a 3 low turnout or 41000 few vote cast than four year before 
  the most serious curtailment to voting right and turnout in wisconsin be due to the extreme and restrictive photo voter i d law    say jay heck director of common cause a nonpartisan government accountability group in the state the same year 600000 people in texas be estimate to lack the id need to vote under the state s strict guideline virginia put new restriction on organization and notforprofit that be register people to vote through drive and campaign this year tennessee seek to make such group subject to criminal penalty if they make mistake for many americans even find a voting booth present a formidable challenge a report release a few month ago by the the leadership conference education fund a civil right organization reveal that 1688 polling place have be shut since 2012 these closure have take place in state with history of racial discrimination in election include 214 precinct closure in georgia as sean young legal director for the american civil liberties union of georgia tell the atlanta journal constitution    our election official be suppose to defend and protect our democracy instead many have be aggressively push poll closure in community of color with phony pretext  
 ten per cent of georgia s county be leave with a single precinct for all voter with some have to travel mile to cast their vote outrank georgia texas have 760 poll closure and arizona have 320 these poll closure be a direct result of the change to the voting right act in 2013 previously georgia be one of nine state that have to get preclearance before they shutter polling station or make change to electoral law that be no long the case and if strict voter i d law and the closure of polling booth aren t sufficient deterrent there be yet more way to discourage and suppress the vote another method be call a voter purge    and it be precisely what happen to christine jordan king s cousin jordan think she be register to vote when she go to the poll she hadn t change her residence or her name yet she have still be wipe from the roll like 17 million other people in the us between 2016 and 2018 accord to the brennan center 
  voter purging be when official scrub name from the voter roll ostensibly to ensure people don t vote twice and that people who have die or move get remove from the roll these be perfectly legitimate justification yet it tend to be on the rise the brennan center report in area and state that previously would have be prevent from make such change by the voting right act place that be with a history of vote discrimination and as the brennan center report    problem arise when state remove voter who be still eligible to vote state rely on faulty datum that purport to show that a voter have move to another state 
  oftentime these datum get people mix up in big state like california and texas multiple individual can have the same name and date of birth make it hard to be sure that the right voter be be purge when perfect datum be unavailable one infamous system the interstate voter registration crosscheck system have be use by dozen of state since it be introduce in 2005 to search for people who be register in more than one jurisdiction a 2017 study find that crosscheck be 99 more likely to purge legitimate rather than inadmissible voter the author of the study state    we find that one of crosscheck s propose purging strategy would eliminate about 300 registration use to cast a seemingly legitimate vote for every one registration use to cast a double vote  
 weigh up the combine impact of strict i d law poll closure and voter purge and you be still nowhere close to estimate the number of people who be actively deter from vote in the us another approximately 47 million americans be prevent from vote at all this be the number of convict felon who have no right to vote include those incarcerate for grave crime such as homicide and rape but also encompass charge include burglary and repeat drive under the influence fortyeight state have some form of felon disenfranchisement but three state iowa kentucky and virginia disenfranchise people for life the impact be disproportionate one in 13 african americans have lose their right to vote as a result compare with one in 56 nonblack voter accord to the sentencing project jevon gerrard stevens a 42yearold water treatment plant operator for miamidade county water and sewer department in florida be convict of thirddegree grand theft auto in 1998 which result in his jailing for three month he hasn t be able to vote for 21 year 
  it s a way for those that be in power to control the less fortunate and once you become a convict felon you fall right into that category    he say there be sign however of a nationwide change in sentiment until recently florida have one of the strict felon disenfranchisement rule in the country then in late 2018 a majority of floridian vote to return the franchise to felon after they leave prison to stevens delight the move which have be contest by republicans have the potential to restore the vote to 14 million people in the state a not insignificant number consider that the margin between trump and hillary clinton in the last presidential election in florida be just 12 point there be numerous other way politician and operative have work to dilute the power of americans vote many state allow gerrymandering or the drawing of electoral district line to favor one party by pack voter from another party into as few district as possible leave they with few seat after election day in a remarkable move in july the supreme court decide not to offer a ruling in a 54 majority decision on partisan gerrymandering it be say in effect that it would not find partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional in an excoriate dissent elena kagan and the court s liberal justice accuse the court s majority of shirk its duty 
  the partisan gerrymander in these case deprive citizen of the most fundamental of their constitutional right the right to participate equally in the political process to join with other to advance political belief and to choose their political representative  
 it be for all the issue cite here that have pledge to put the issue of voting right at the heart of our 2020 coverage and we be not alone there be a grow if still small movement of people and organization that be similarly motivate by the need to return the vote to as many americans as possible both stacey abrams the 2018 georgia gubernatorial candidate and eric holder barack obama s onetime attorney general have devote themselves to the issue while group like black voter matter and voto latino have national strategy to get people to poll and some state be choose to adopt automatic voter registration or sameday registration    after a decade of pass restrictive voting law like voter i d momentum be shift toward pass small piece of catchup legislation to far modernize state voting system    say chapman rackaway a professor of political science at the university of west georgia",theguardian,0

diversity this first week in march with three potential nominee all three be age white man joe biden bernie sander and mike bloomberg all three if nominate and elect would soon celebrate their 80th

november and not only will the white house be lose all hope of win the senate and block trump s secondterm supreme court nominee would also be lose and not only the senate but nancy pelosi s house

the establishment today promise to a fateful one in the history of the democratic party and it will answer many question will sander win enough delegate to give he an insurmountable lead for the nomination or will he have a good but not a great night win most of the state but not a large enough pile of delegate to reach 50 before the convention in milwaukee as for mayor mike bloomberg who be be urge to drop out and back biden before he get the first return on his 500 million investment in his campaign what do he buy with that half billion we shall find out today if his performance be disappointing will he yield to the establishment and do what it demand to advance the killing of sander candidacy as for biden the question be clear and crucial will the momentum from saturday s victory be sustain and replicate in alabama and other southern and border state where the african american share of the democratic electorate be similar to south carolina s will today provide the clarity the establishment and biden want and make this a bidensander race with those two come into the convention with large bloc of delegate but neither with a majority what the establishment want be for the first ballot to end without a nominee if that nominee would be sander and the pledge delegate to be free of their commitment and for the superdelegate to vote on the second ballot and for the party thus to be spare fall into the custody of an angry septuagenarian socialist for the democratic establishment the stake could not be high and thus that establishment after biden s landslide in south carolina be not disguise its interest or demand sander must be deny the nomination and biden be the only one who can accomplish that biden might have win south carolina without the endorsement of veteran african american congressman jim clyburn but it be clyburn s blessing that give biden his landslide and if biden win alabama and other state today the major factor of his victory will be his south carolina landslide and his support from african americans should biden win the nomination still a long shot he will be in deep political debt look for biden to put an african american woman

  I think that s a very dangerous game to play    he say add    that s not your job  
 instead he call on house speaker john boehner and other gop leader in control of the house to get back to the business of pass legislation that keep the current tax rate where they be now 
  if they pass a bill that extend the tax cut for everybody and every single one of the republican house member go on local tv and local radio and say we have now pass a middle class tax extension all the president have to do be sign it    you would have a totally different debate go on the next day    gingrich say the former speaker try that approach in the 1990 during budget negotiation with then president bill clinton the standoff lead to a series of government shutdown for which republicans be generally blame by voter recall those year gingrich say it be not easy but in the end a deal be reach that both side could live with

  the whole idea of common core be to bring student and school under a common definition of what success be    say tom loveless a senior fellow at the brookings institution    and common core be not go to have that one of its fundamental argument have be knock out from under it  
 no child leave behind president george w bush s signature education law require state to test student each year in math and read in grade three to eight and again in high school congress have be debate way to overhaul the law the house and senate have approve differ version this summer that would maintain the testing requirement but let state decide how to use the result the common corealigne test fulfill the federal requirement yet be significantly different from the exam that student be accustom to take rather than paperandpencil multiple choice test the new exam be design to be take by tablet or computer instead of be give a selection of answer to choose student must show how they get their answer answer correctly and get a more difficult question answer incorrectly get an easy one field test administer last year indicate that a majority of student would not score as proficient in math and read on the test so this summer state have brace for the result meet with parent and principal to explain why the result will be different at los angeles unify school district cynthia lim executive director of the office of datum and accountability say the preliminary result receive by the nation s second large district be low than what people be use to see    district official be consult with school leader about how to explain to parent and student that new test result should not be compare with old one

  we be lose that that statetostate comparability after this year unfortunately    potter say    but our legislature have say we should have missouri standard so that be the route we be take  
 aside from the defection the exam have also experience from technical glitch and an optout movement that surface this spring result in nevada montana and north dakota be hit with widespread technical problem nevada count last year s score a total loss in oregon slightly more than 95 percent of student take the exam just make the federal requirement for participation for black and special education student as well as some district the requirement be not meet mean the state could potentially lose federal fund most state have not be able to release test score before the start of class a delay that be expect in the exam s first year but nonetheless frustrating for some teacher and parent

  the trump administration have be a disaster for endangered specie    say noah greenwald endanger species director at the center for biological diversity    the stated intent be to expand oil and gas drilling it be quite possible we will lose specie because of the hostility and callousness show by this administration

  every day the endangered specie act inspire countless conservation partnership and collaboration between federal and state agency private company conservation organization and landowner to conserve imperiled specie before they require federal protection    say a usfws spokeswoman

dioxide and be so grossly flaw it should play no role in we energy policy analysis and co2 regulatory process    the scientist do not have any affiliation with any particular organization and have work together pro bono for several yearsamong the signatory be dr george wolff who formerly chair the environmental protection agency s clean air scientific advisory committee joseph s daleo a fellow with the american meteorological society dr neil laverne frank former director of the national hurricane center in florida and william m bill gray emeritus professor of atmospheric science at colorado state universitythe author criticize the nca report for a lack of objectivity and its failure to include input from scientist who may question whether climate change be irrefutable and that a robust regulatory response be require    science derive its objectivity from robust logic and honest evidence repeatedly test by all knowledgeable scientist not just those pay to support the administration s version of global warming    climate change    climate disruption    or whatever their marketing specialist call it today    they saidthe nca and the white house assert that urgent action be need because increase average temperature in the united states be responsible for a great frequency of extreme weather eventsaccorde to the nca average temperature have increase between 13 degree fahrenheit and 19 degree fahrenheit since 1895 and forecasting model show a potential increase of an additional 4 degree fahrenheit if countermeasure be not adopt include capandtrade great subsidization of green energy and reduce fossil fuel productionaccorde to the nca    human influence be the primary driver of recent climate change be base on multiple line of independent evidence    the scientist describe that contention as grossly flaw and take issue with the epa s claim use to justify greenhouse gas regulation that there be 9099 percent certainty that observe warm in the latter half of the twentieth century result from human activity    that claim be totally at odd with multiple robust consistent independentlyderive empirical dataset all show no statistically significant positive or negative trend in temperature    they write    therefore epa s theory must be reject    the group of scientist make similar point in a supreme court amicus involve epa regulation of greenhouse gas emission from new motor vehiclesin the brief the scientist assert epa s entire hypothesis that co2 emission endanger human health and safety have be falsify by realworld evidence    as the most important example epa assert as its central line of evidence for co2 endangerment that co2 will warm the surface temperature of the earth through a mechanism by which rise co2 concentration in the troposphere in the tropic block heat transfer into outer space    they say that if epa s hypothesis be accurate there would necessarily be an observable hot spot in the tropical upper troposphere but that have not be prove to exist therefore they write the basis that epa have for this rulemaking be no basis    they write accord to their rebuttal report    over the last 130 year the decade of the 1930 still have the most we state high temperature record    their assertion that climate disruption be not increase ironically be echo in the most recent report issue by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc    which the white house often cite to support its own argumentglobally accord to the ipcc in its 2012 special report on extreme event    since the 1950 some region of the world have experience a trend to more intense and long drought in particular in southern europe and west africa but in some region drought have become less frequent less intense or short for example in central north america and northwestern australia    furthermore the ipcc in 2013 conclude that current dataset indicate no significant observed trend in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century and no robust trend in annual number of tropical storm hurricane and major hurricane count have be identify over the past 100 year in the north atlantic basin    the scientist also dispute the administration s claim that propose regulation of carbon dioxide can be achieve in a costeffective manner that will create job and produce economic benefit rather they argue those policy will restrict economic growth cause harm to the poor    unilateral co2 emission control by the united states promise to damage the economy of the united states without any benefit in fact increase co2 in the atmosphere facilitate achieve the goal of raise the poor out of poverty through increase food production    the scientist write in their amicus brief,newsmax,2

 trump aide may be in legal jeopardy as democrats give evidence to mueller read more now it look like it be go to happen but the public face of the investigation of trump s finance win t be muell lead the charge will be someone trump can not fire california congressman adam schiff newly instal chairman of the house intelligence committee and a former federal prosecutor himself with democrats having take over the house trump face a pack of potential antagonist newly instal chair be ramp up plan to scrutinize corruption inside the trump administration investigate allege attempt to profit from the presidency and to review policy such as family border separation but most threaten for trump personally might be the investigation lead by schiff who have say he plan to drive directly at an area the president have seek to fence off the detail of his business his lender and his partner in the us and abroad 
  first and foremost I would say that we need to get to the bottom of anything that could warp our national security policy in a way that be antithetical to the interest of the country    schiff tell the lawfare podcast    so anything that have a continue ability to influence the action of the president we need to know as policymaker to protect the country 
  one of the issue that have continue to concern I be the persistent allegation that the trump when they couldn t get money from us bank be launder russian money if that be true that would be more powerful compromise than any salacious video tape or any aborted trump tower deal  
 schiff might break new ground by use his power to subpoena document from bank phone company or other source say andy wright a former counsel to the house oversight committee and found editor of the just security blog 
  I think that there s actually go to be quite a bit of fruitful evidence turn up    wright say    I don t know what the evidence be whether it s go to be incriminate or not but I don t think that the sort of conventional wisdom that trump s just go to drag his foot or strike a warlike posture    be go to be that effective because the smart investigator aren t go to go directly at he they re go to go to third party first  
 one of the first matter he plan to investigate schiff tell nbc last month be the trump organization s relationship with deutsche bank for a time reportedly trump s exclusive lender which be fine 700 m in 2017 for allow money launder 
  the concern about deutsche bank be that they have a history of launder russian money    schiff say    and this apparently be the one bank that be willing to do business with the trump organization if this be a form of compromise it need to be expose  
 a graduate of stanford and harvard schiff 58 begin his career as an assistant us attorney in the los angeles district where he successfully prosecute richard miller the first fbi agent to be convict of espionage as a young politician schiff be cultivate by nancy pelosi then head of california s congressional delegation now again speaker of the house schiff be a triathlete a screenwriter and a vegan he also like to go on television where he have catch the attention of the president who last year respond to a critique with a tweet mock the congressman s last name and float a misleading notion about the statute govern the special counsel donald j trump    realdonaldtrump so funny to see little adam schitt dca talk about the fact that act attorney general matt whitaker be not approve by the senate but not mention the fact that bob mueller who be highly conflicted be not approve by the senate while schiff have show he can fire back at trump he will need to steer clear of such partisan warfare to be an effective committee chairman say jamil n jaffer founder of the national security institute at the antonin scalia law school at george mason university and a former senior counsel to the committee schiff now lead 
  schiff have an opportunity now to try and change that tone because as the chairman he can set the tone    jaffer say    we ll see if he s able to do that successfully we re in a very nasty environment in washington dc right now the atmosphere be poisonous after the 2016 election everyone have a responsibility to get past that  
 schiff will use subpoena power if trump quash final mueller report read more schiff take over a committee that have be badly tarnish in the eye of the public and significantly in the regard of the intelligence community under devin nune a trump confidant who serve on the transition team the committee raise hackle by release classified material describe scrutiny of a former trump aide schiff have call the episode a spectacular breach of a compact we have with the intelligence community and say we re go to have to restore that  
  if the committee do its job in the right manner it shouldn t be antagonistic to any particular president or the executive branch generally    jaffer say    it should be do good effective oversight  
 under nune the committee end conversation with the special counsel s office about what witness might be call and other matter schiff have say he will restore that communication on sunday he tell cnn the committee would be hand over transcript of closeddoor testimony something republican leader do not do schiff do not name name but such a move could place in jeopardy trump aide include donald trump jr jared kushner and roger stone but the role of congress be fundamentally different from the special counsel s job schiff tell lawfare especially give concern that a report issue by mueller might in some way be suppress in a justice department run by whitaker apparently a staunch trump loyalist 
  I think ultimately it will fall on congress to make sure that the american people will get to hear the full story    schiff say    either through our own investigation or bob mueller s or a combination of both 
  the american people have the right to know and I think in many case the need to know what happen",theguardian,0

 ivanka trump say liberal have unrealistic expectation of she read more several country include austria bulgaria the czech republic hungary japan latvia lithuania norway and slovakia guarantee over a year s worth of pay leave estonia offer the most support allocate more than a year and a half of pay leave to new parent while there have be no notable momentum in the republicanle congress to address pay family leave in a substantial way a modest proposal by the nebraska senator deb fischer be include in the tax plan pass by the senate early saturday along a partyline vote the provision aim to incentivize company to provide up to 12 week of pay parental or medical leave by offer up a tax credit cap at 25 to employer who voluntarily do so but even that minor olive branch be not include in a tax plan pass by the house of representative last month and it remain to be see if republican in both chamber will agree to leave it in a final bill the provision have also be sharply criticize by democrat and progressive group as offer yet another tax break for company rather than rally behind a clear mandate that employer offer pay family leave the pay leave tax credit would only be temporary and even some conservative economist have argue it would have little impact ivanka who have maintain pay family leave remain on the administration s agenda instead pour her effort during tax reform negotiation into expand what be know as the child tax credit after initially suggest a deduction for childcare expense which critic say would disproportionately favor highincome household like her own ivanka throw her support behind a measure author by senator marco rubio and mike lee that would double an exist 1000perchild tax credit the senator put forward an amendment that would help offset the cost of what would have amount to an 87bn expansion of the child tax credit by cut the corporate tax rate to 21    the republican tax plan have instead propose slash the corporate tax rate to 20    down from its current 35    at the request of trump ivanka who engage in several discussion on the issue with rubio lee and a handful of other senate republicans use her platform to push for the plan but even there her clout prove limited as her father through a white house spokesman swiftly object to the measure day before the senate s tax vote while the tax bill pass by senate republicans still double the nonrefundable tax credit from 1000 annually per child to 2000 the rubiolee amendment to expand the credit to million of poor family be vote down ivanka still praise the passage of the tax plan tweet on monday    last week the senate bring we one major step close to historic taxreform we now look forward to congress reconcile the two bill and sign the tax cut job act into law together  
 outside group align with democrats say ivanka have once again fall short on the promise she have make to woman by hail a bill contain vast tax cut for the wealthy americans and do little in the end to improve the economic condition of work family democrats have push a bill with far broad ramification than ivanka s proposal seek to provide up to 12 week of leave for family and medical purpose with partial pay the legislation introduce by the new york senator kirsten gillibrand and know as the family act would establish a nationwide insurance program to pay for the leave fund by employer and employee payroll contribution emily s list which work toward elect prochoice democratic woman liken ivanka s effort for woman to windowdresse    like everything this administration do ivanka trump and the republican party s childcare tax credit benefit the wealthy while do almost nothing to make childcare more affordable for work family    alexandra deluca a spokeswoman for the group say 
  ivanka can claim that she be a champion for woman but as long as she continue to prop up an administration that try at every turn to roll back the clock on woman s right woman win t believe her  
 but even as ivanka s performance remain under constant scrutiny she have slowly step back from the spotlight and take on a more diminished role when compare with the early month of the trump administration as the special counsel robert mueller have escalate the federal inquiry into potential collusion between the trump presidential campaign and russia ivanka and her husband jared kushner have assume a quieter presence in the west wing kushner remain a person of interest in the investigation stem from his own series of previously undisclosed contact with the russians accord to a new york times report publish last month the white house chief of staff john kelly have discuss the possibility of ivanka and kushner leave the white house by the end of the year    kelly dispute he have ever contemplate getting rid of jared and ivanka   
 ivanka have often grow visibly frustrate by the backlash she have incur on account of her father where be ivanka trump s concern for woman s right when you need it    jessica valenti read more when a saturday night live sketch pillory trump s eld daughter as complicit in the most controversial aspect of father s agenda ivanka respond    I don t know what it mean to be complicit but I hope time will prove that I have do a good job and much more importantly that my father s administration be the success that I know it will be  
 while speak alongside the german chancellor angela merkel at a panel in april ivanka be boo by the crowd when she claim her father be an advocate of woman s right she also baffle woman s group by support her father s decision to terminate an obamaera rule design to close the gender pay gap by well understand pattern of wage discrimination break down by both gender and race some nonetheless argue the responsibility ivanka often bear be not commensurate with her position    put any singular blame on ivanka trump for these policy not go through would be unfair    say kelly dittmar of rutgers university 
  the accountability on these issue ultimately rest with those who be make the policy in this case the president and the head of various executive agency as well as congress  
 dittmar nonetheless say it be fair to evaluate whether ivanka have be able to influence the policy of her father s administration    we often look to woman in any administration to be the one to stand up for woman s issue    she say    obviously man and woman equally need to take on these issue as important    dittmar add    the difference with ivanka be she s tout these issue she s say these be mine and these be my priority  
 in the leadup to an entrepreneur summit in the indian city of hyderabad last month billboard of ivanka be erect around town read    when woman succeed we all succeed  
 it be a theme ivanka propound in her keynote address to the summit    as a former entrepreneur employer and executive in a maledominate industry I have see firsthand that all too often woman must do more than their male counterpart to prove themselves at work while also disproportionately care for their family at home    ivanka say 
  after my father s election I see an opportunity to leave my business for the privilege of serve our country and empower all americans include woman to succeed  
 she run down a list of initiative the white house be propose to improve upon the status quo for american woman especially those in business    our administration be advance policy that enable woman to pursue their career and care for their family    she say",theguardian,0

 trump point with his finger republicans rise to applaud and democrats sit unmoved as the president paint a rosy future    die industry will come roar back to life heroic veteran will get the care they so desperately need our military will be give the resource its brave warrior so richly deserve 
  crumble infrastructure will be replace with new road bridge tunnel airport and railway gleam across our very very beautiful land our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop and our neglect inner city will see a rebirth of hope safety and opportunity above all else we will keep our promise to the american people  
 trump claim that since his inauguration numerous company have announce that they would invest billion and billion of dollar in the we and create ten of thousand of new job but a bloomberg analysis have find most of these case predate trump do not actually create job or have nothing to do with he when the president claim he have already begin to drain the swamp of government corruption there be some sarcastic laughter from democrats who could see in attendance his cabinet with its strong wall street and boardroom connection trump repeat his promise to soon begin the construction of a great great wall on the mexican border and say gang member drug dealer and criminal be currently be deport    bad one be go out as I speak tonight    he say in a marked shift from obama he use the phrase radical islamic terrorism with relish pause after each word for dramatic effect when promise to protect the american people trump s congress speech be a heroic effort in contradiction and cliche read more he do not seek to defend his travel ban in detail a new version be expect on wednesday but he defend the principle    it be not compassionate but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from place where proper vetting can not occur we can not allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside america we can not allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremist  
 trump then shift to claim he have inherit a mess from 94 million americans out of the labour force this appear to include retire people and student    to high national debt to a trade deficit of nearly 800bn to tragic foreign policy disaster  
 he attempt to strike a conciliatory bipartisan note gesture towards democrats as he say    solve these and so many other press problem will require we to work past the difference of party  
 but soon enough there be a dubious claim    right now american company be tax at one of the high rate anywhere in the world in fact the us be not even in the 30 highesttaxed nation in the world accord to the organization for economic cooperation and development 
  my economic team be develop historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our company so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone it will be a big big cut at the same time we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class

  our citizen deserve this and so much more so why not join force to finally get the job do and get it do right on this and so many other thing democrat and republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the american people

 he also make clear his law and order priority albeit in more measured tone than on the campaign trail    we must work with not against not against the man and woman of law enforcement    he say    we must build bridge of cooperation and trust not drive the wedge of disunity and division it s pure unadulterated division we have to unify

 in florida group report that new hispanic voter registration be run at 1000 a week    some 26 million hispanic be eligible to vote in florida for this year s general election and about 800000 of they have not yet register  
 that unprecedented number correspond not coincidentally latino organizer believe with poll that show almost nine in 10 latino floridian view trump unfavorably in iowa the latino community have be virtually silent until this year in 2012 only 1000 latinos participate in the iowa presidential caucus this year the number soar to 13000 about 25 of all register hispanic voter 
  clearly they be worried about the rhetoric specifically of trump we could not have mobilize the community anything like as effectively without he    say joe henry of the league of united latin american citizen in nevada a state where almost one in five of the 19 million eligible voter be latino an aggressive push to mobilize the community have start to bear fruit among some 362000 latinos who be still unregistered for the november ballot even in arizona which have vote democratic only once in a presidential race in the past 60 year hispanic activist hope to bring the state into play by register up to 75000 firsttime voter they have already expand by 125000 since 2010 to a total of 536003 register hispanic voter 144 of the overall voter pool

 arizona s electorate be in the midst of rapid change one in five eligible voter in the state be hispanic accord to a recent analysis by the pew research center it estimate that 13 million arizona latinos will be eligible to vote in 2016 up from 796000 in 2008 young latinos make up a large share of the hispanic electorate nearly twice as many hispanic voter in arizona be millennial compare with their white counterpart accord to 2014 pew datum arizona have historically be a conservative state but the change demographic and the prospective general election race between trump and clinton have activist and expert predict that this will be the year arizona latinos realize their political force and sweep democrats in to power 
  it s exciting for we in arizona because we keep getting talk about as a purple state as possibly a swing state    say kate gallego the vicemayor of phoenix that would be astonishing since the second world war arizona have only once vote for the democratic presidential candidate bill clinton in 1996 so could it happen 
  certainly john mccain think so    gallego say refer to comment record at a private fundraiser in which the longserve arizona senator say trump could threaten his chance of be reelect    if donald trump be at the top of the ticket here in arizona with over 30 of the vote be the hispanic vote no doubt that this may be the race of my life    mccain be report to have say yet even if record turnout be to turn the solidly red state blue arizona s 11 electoral vote would probably be superfluous as the outcome be unlikely to shift the dynamic of the race if trump be to be the motivation that finally unleash the electoral power of arizona s latinos the achievement will not be his alone he will also have to credit the assistance of two of his most ardent supporter sheriff joe arpaio of maricopa county the selfstyle tough sheriff in america    and jan brewer the former arizona governor who sign into law one of the harsh state immigration measure in the country in 2010 arizona enact senate bill 1070 a draconian law aim at drive out the state s undocumented immigrant that push the state to the forefront of an acrimonious debate over border security and comprehensive immigration reform yet instead of disappear the law draw many of the state s undocumented immigrant out of the shadow latinos joined force with business leader concern about the economic impact of the law together ten of thousand march through the street of downtown phoenix in opposition 
  we have see many trump in arizona    say ian danley a director with one arizona speak after a meeting on voter suppression in phoenix    we be birth out of sb 1070 which be a trumplike policy we weren t prepare in 2010 we re prepare now  
 one arizona a nonpartisan network of hispanic and immigrant group work to increase latino voter turnout in the state have register between 110000 and 125000 new voter since 2010 and help triple the number of latinos enrol in the state s early voting system now the network have set itself the ambitious target of register between 60000 and 75000 new voter by november because volunteer be restrict from tell registrant who to vote for and the group doesn t track registrant party affiliation it s hard to assess the trump effect    anecdotally several volunteer say it be not uncommon for registrant to ask which party trump belong to and then tick the opposite box 
  people be pay a lot of attention    say raquel terán the state director for mi vota familia sip vegan horchata at a coffee shop in downtown phoenix when donald trump come to arizona in march he hold his rally in fountain hill a predominantly white town in maricopa county he be join by brewer the former governor and introduce by arpaio the controversial sheriff who have cost taxpayer ten of million of dollar in an ongoing racial profiling case that find his officer have target latinos during raid and traffic stop 
  we have a little problem some demonstrator be try to disrupt    arpaio tell the crowd which begin to boo and hiss    if they think they re go to intimidate you and the next president of the united states it s not go to happen not in this town  
  I call that the hate and fear playbook    say petra falcon a longtime arizona activist and director of the right group promise arizona    if you want to divide a country or a state just take out that playbook and start talk about the harm immigrant do they come here to take your job they rob he take that playbook from arizona and be use it nationally  
 the big challenge for arizona s democrats remain voter turnout there be approximately 170000 more register republicans than democrats in the state accord to the late datum from the secretary of state s office in the primary on 22 march 55 of republican cast ballot compare with 49 of democrats however register independent who make up the large share of arizona voter but be not represent by a party could not vote in either primary at an outlet mall in tempe josé barboza and francis sullivan of promise arizona take turn approach shopper and sale associate with their clipboard jaritma avilez tell barboza she be register to vote and he move on but later avilez admit to that even though she be register she didn t plan on vote in november    I don t feel like politic really affect my life    she shrug 
  in november the latino community be go to come out in large number    jocelyn sida a nevada organizer for mi familia vota which work to increase hispanic turnout tell     a lot of millennial like myself be getting involve in leadership role to educate and engage the community and it s be very accept they re not withdraw they re not close their door to we on the contrary they re seek we out to find way to get involve  
 with 17 of nevada s electorate be hispanic the latino vote certainly have the potential to deny trump victory through strong turnout in 2012 70 of nevada latinos vote for obama help he to win the state by a comfortable sixpoint margin 
  all the time trump s yell about kick people out the country it s horrible    say rodulfo martinez 60 a las vegas construction worker express an anger feel by many    the way he insult we isn t right many of the thing he say about the border wall and why latinos come here don t make sense  
 a poll last month by latino decision show that immigration reform be the most pressing issue for nevada hispanic the state have the country s large percentage of undocumented immigrant many of whom count register voter as friend and family 
  está loco    say vicky legaspi 36 echo fumero in miami a restaurant owner on las vegas s workingclass east side legaspi nearly choke on a spoon of ice cream when ask if she would vote for the celebrity businessman    he just want attention he doesn t care about this country

168,https://www.newsmax.com/andrewnapolitano/contagion-quarantine-trial/2020/03/12/id/957982/,the issue of whether government in america can quarantine person against their will ostensibly for their own health and that of other with whom they may come in contact require a dual analysis one of the power of the federal government and the other of the power of the state for constitutional analysis purpose since local and regional government derive their power from the state in which they be locate the analysis of state power pertain to they as well we begin our analysis with the observation of the truism that freedom be the default position the language of the declaration of independence as well as various amendment in the bill of right unambiguously reflect the view that those who write ratify and amend the constitution recognize that our right to think speak publish worship defend ourselves travel own property be leave alone be natural to our humanity these right preexist the government their source be our humanity government do not grant these right rather its primary purpose as state in the declaration of independence its sole purpose be to protect these right though the court have interpret the constitution to possess lamentable exception the framer and ratifier arguably accept the nonaggression principle articulate in the modern era by the late professor murray rothbard which declare that all aggression against person and property even by government be immoral in the case of the federal government it be one of limited delegate power of course 230 year of legislation and litigation have blow its power outside the confine of the constitution and invariably in the direction of expand federal power at the expense of personal liberty and the state the state form the federal government and not the other way around yet today the fed stay in power by bribe the state with cash grant the rich with bailout the middle class with tax break and the poor with transfer payment notwithstanding all this the court continue to recognize the concept of personal liberty in a free society all this be background to the issue lurk beneath the headline this week can the government quarantine people without proof of contagion and imminent assault the short answer be no we know that under the fifth amendment if any government state or federal want to impair the life liberty or property of any person it must follow due process the substantive component ask if the impairment of liberty be proper to the government that seek the impairment and the procedural component ask if the impairment have come about fairly now back to what the fed can do and what the state can do in a public health crisis there be no emergency provision or trigger in the constitution yet congress give itself the power to regulate public health and safety under various pretext the pretext exist because the nanny state urge of member of congress to regulate be confront by the reservation in the tenth amendment of health and safety to the state those pretext be regulate commerce and all that affect commerce and pay the state to do congress will state differently the supreme court have rule that both the federal government and the state can confine a person who have not commit a crime or one who have but have serve one s full sentence in order to protect society from the person s intentional or uncontrollable harmful tendency it be contrary to the plain meaning of the constitution for congress to give itself power that be not delegate to it by the constitution but the court have permit this yet even in the case of a lunatic who have commit a crime and serve his full sentence but remain dangerous the court have recognize constitutional safeguard to protect his natural right now back to our question of whether the government state or federal can confine person against their will in order to protect public health the short answer be yes but the constitution require procedural due process thus a governmentordere quarantine of all person in a city block or a postal zip code or a telephone area code would be an egregious violation of due process both substantive and procedural substantively no government in america have the lawful power to curtail natural right by decree procedurally notwithstanding the fear of disease contagion the state and fed may only quarantine those who be actively contagious and will infect other imminently and it must present evidence of both at a trial at which it bear the burden of proof while the nonaggression principle permit offensive aggression in selfdefense when an attack be imminent and certain that be a high standard for the government to meet as it should be freedom even the freedom of a madman or a dangerously sick and contagious person be the default position infringe upon it without procedural due process be always constitutionally impermissible the constitution be not write for the government to right every wrong we know that government itself cause most wrong the theft of property by taxation the impairment of economic liberty by regulation the slaughter of innocent by war the infringement of expressive liberty by majority vote yet the constitution still mandate an exact due process for all whom the government would restrain that mean a trial before any quarantine no matter the public danger and a fair trial not one animate by mass hysteria or governmentgenerate fear judge andrew p napolitano be the young lifetenure superior court judge in the history of new

journal and whose friendship I have enjoy for many year recently put forth a hypothetical historical analogy that stop I in my track late last week the us house of representative adopt a resolution authorize formal investigation into whether president donald trump have commit impeachable offense while in office the resolution direct five house stand committee to investigate the president s behavior and to report the result of those investigation to the house judiciary committee under house rule enact in january 2015 when republican have the majority the judiciary committee have jurisdiction over impeachment and it must air publicly the evidence it contend support any article of impeachment it may recommend to the full house the constitution define and limit the basis for impeachment as treason bribery or other high crime and misdemeanor    in trump s case it be bribery or other high crime that have form the basis of the impeachment inquiry thus far the house permanent select committee on intelligence have be hold closeddoor hearing gather evidence on these two point of constitutional inquiry no prosecutor or defense counsel would or ethically could offer a witness to testify publicly in a case without first having interview that witness in private these interview be often openende and the lawyer or investigator conduct the interview do not know in advance the full extent of what the witness can provide secrecy at this point enhance candor and permit an honest evaluation of the witness s credibility and usefulness to the case in the case of president richard nixon and bill clinton special prosecutor gather evidence of presidential wrongdoing in secret and then present that evidence to the house judiciary committee which air it publicly today even though the initial interview of witness be take place in secret the intelligence committee be release transcript of those interview for the public to examine well before it report to the house judiciary committee we know from those transcript that trump s threat to hold up 391 million in military hardware and financial aid to our ally ukraine which be fight a bloody war with russia until the ukraine government give he a favor by commence an investigation of former vice president joe biden and his son hunter be not a oneoff we know from the testimony of these witness that the demand for the favor be the end part of a month long concert effort run by the president s personal lawyer rudy giuliani himself now the subject of two federal criminal investigation to use the government of ukraine to deliver dirt on biden for trump s reelection campaign trump have argue that this be not a quid pro quo eg give I the dirt on biden and you will get your american aid he make that argument solely on an incomplete transcript of his nowinfamous july 25 2019 telephone conversation with his ukrainian counterpart who when he ask for the aid be meet with the request for the favor now back to peggy noonan in her piece in last saturday s wall street journal she ask how history would view president franklin delano roosevelt if when ask by british prime minister winston churchill for help fight the nazi in 1940 he have condition that aid on the provision of dirt on wendell willkie roosevelt s eventual republican opponent in the 1940 presidential election we would be repulse to learn this of course roosevelt never make such a trumpian demand he understand how vital the defense of great britain from the nazi invasion be for humanity for our ally and ultimately for american national security trump s demand manifest no such rooseveltian understanding in fact trump should have know that the act of solicit assistance for his campaign from a foreign government whether directly by he or indirectly by giuliani be define as criminal under federal law a high crime as the constitution put it he also should have know that refuse to perform a lawful duty release the 391 million congress have authorize until a personal favor come his way be also define in federal law as criminal bribery as the constitution put it all of this have be lay out in the transcript of witness interview that will soon become public testimony all of this have give the president s congressional supporter heartburn they have see the transcript and have drop their no quid pro quo argument and now make the legally absurd contention that all evidence derive from witness interview conduct in secret with republican house member present and participatingis somehow taint and should be throw out even nixon and clinton make no such argument then in another pivot congressional republicans have argue that witness against trump be secret or overt democrats and can not be trust oy that s why we have crossexamination some congressional republican have even threaten to out two federal employee among the witness whose identity be protect under the federal whistleblower statute statute that these member of congress have swear to uphold oh how the time have change roosevelt jump at the chance to help an ally fight a tyrant the noonan analogy be brilliant and tell and the president s

  this be a way of the party tip its hat to recognition that black voter play an outsize role in primary selection particularly in south carolina and on super tuesday    say ted johnson a senior fellow at the brennan centre for justice who specialize in race and electoral politic 
  these state also have black mayor in place like birmingham alabama and jackson mississippi so even though they be red state their significant black population be important for the primary and signal the role of local black governance in organize voter participation and turnout level

  go into this I be hope that we would see the black vote split across maybe three or four candidate in order to break the myth that black voter all vote the same think the same have the same policy preference but because trump be such a polarizing figure and so unpopular among black voter the thing that s mobilize most black voter be beat trump and the idea be that joe biden be in the good position to do so  
 although other socalle top tier candidate like masachusett senator elizabeth warren and vermont senator bernie sanders be currently struggle to poll over double digit among black voter in south carolina despite their expansive racial justice platform it be south bend mayor pete buttigieg that lag furthest behind accord to a poll release on monday buttigieg with his chequered record on race and police in indiana be attract 0 support among african americans in the state despite this the 37 yearold be expect to be target by his rival during the debate follow recent polling in iowa that place he in the lead wednesday could also mark an opportunity for us senators kamala harris and cory booker the only black candidate in the field to reconnect with the electorate after fall out of the top tier in recent month it have not escape many observer that despite this be the most diverse democratic primary in history the entire top tier be compose of white candidate former housing secretary julián castro the only latino candidate in the field have not qualified for the debate due to polling number tom steyer the white billionaire hedge fund manager who have never hold elect office will appear 
  I think there s work for the democratic party to do frankly    say keneshia grant assistant professor of political science at howard university    in term of figure out what they can do to increase the likelihood that their diversity be reflect at the top of the ticket  
 critic of georgia s new voting machine accuse of election interference read more grant recognize the pragmatism among african american voter describe by johnson but caution that current polling should not be see as determinate of the final outcome 
  I think there be many black voter who don t get report on who have imagination who remember barack obama be the underdog in 2007 and come from behind to beat hillary clinton and so I would say that even though these poll suggest at this time joe biden be the frontrunner I can imagine a scenario where folk start to change their tune once they believe that another candidate be more viable

  in all of these close race to the extent the democrats win it will be because woman take they over the top    lake say add that democrats win woman by 19 point and lose man by three to four point depend on the exit poll you re look at  
  the one group that have defect from trump be collegeeducate white woman    lake say    those trump voter have go democratic and some have switch their party identification that say democrats still lose white noncollegeeducate woman by a pretty substantial margin  
 the gender gap be insanely high and it s show no sign of get well evan siegfrie republican strategist republican strategist evan siegfried say the party need to find an answer to the exodus of woman in the midterm 
  the gender gap be insanely high and it s show no sign of get well from the republican perspective he say    and yet the party itself be seemingly go to try and push more trumpism  
 go state by state the widen gender gap could spoil trump s map trump lose collegeeducate white woman in 2016 by a 61 35 margin accord to a voting recordsbase analysis by pew research but trump win enough of they to make the difference in large suburban block of pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin and to come close in minnesota 
  the gender gap expand dramatically in pennsylvania in 2018 say christopher borick director of the institute of public opinion at muhlenberg college in allentown 
  throughout the southeast of the state include the lehigh valley you see enormous turnout among woman voter    borick say    and the break toward democrats    accord to the exit poll be just gigantic and that make a lot of these race noncompetitive in term of republicans chance  
 start with educate woman these pollster and strategist say and you have the first ingredient of what could be trump s downfall but while woman represent a majority of voter and be the most reliable voter in any election other ingredient other voting group will be need for a democrat to take the white house not every demographic show erosion in support for trump noncollegeeducate voter and rural voter notably do not show significant movement toward democrats in the midterm the power of trump s base be reflect in the success of republicans at knock off democratic senate incumbent in state like indiana which trump win by 19 point    missouri 185 trump    north dakota 36 and possibly florida but republican strategist worry that the trump base be not big enough to win reelection especially consider how tight his 2016 victory be 
  the base by itself can t sustain this party    say siegfried who have urge republican to reach out more to millennial and nonwhite voter    we need to find thing that be go to excite the base without alienate the rest of the country  
 the forget review ben bradlee jr deliver 2020 lesson for democrat read more one reason trump will not be able to replicate his 2016 victory even if he repeat it be that the electorate have change already    with an influx of new young democratic voter and a shrinkage of old republicans say borick in pennsylvania 
  where you have see decline in voter in the state be in trump county because of age and other factor that portion be modestly down already since 2016    he say    with new voter come in on the side of the democrats  
 the new voter drive democrat to a national popular vote advantage in house race of more than 7    dave wasserman of the cook report have estimate exceed republican margin in their huge wave year of 2010 68 and 1994 71  
  there be some republicans who have point to    oh it wasn t really a blue wave because we beat the historical average for seat loss     say siegfried    um we lose over 30 seat at least 32 and as many as 36    it s sort of like say    yeah the titanic hit the iceberg but all hand weren t lose when it go down   
 educate woman voter young voter and some old voter too all those category be on the move but as hillary clinton find out the hard way a popular majority do not always win the election the map have to be right too so how do it look one of the most painful loss for democrat in 2016 be in wisconsin which have not go for a republican president since ronald reagan but which trump win by less than 1  
 the midterm result in wisconsin potentially point to a well 2020 for democrats the democratic senate incumbent tammy baldwin beat her opponent by 11 point win generous margin throughout the state include the rural west the democrats finally throw out the republican governor scott walker a top presidential prospect just two year ago in michigan the story be similar trump edge the narrow of victory in 2016 win by 03 percentage point but in 2018 the state reelect its democratic senator by six point and democrats pick off two house seat and grab the governorship these be major democratic gain across level of government christopher borick pennsylvania in the upper midwest turnout among nonwhite voter especially african americans appear to be robust a line the democrats will have to hold if they want to win in 2020 successful democrats meanwhile manage to keep the margin with trump s base noncollegeeducate white more rural voter close in pennsylvania the story be similar borick say the state see a really good night for democrats that could have be even well from their perspective

  if trump have lose the benefit of the doubt from voter in pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan he may not have so much of an electoral college advantage in 2020

 on 30 march trump s senior diplomat articulate that position clearly nikki haley the us ambassador to the united nations muse that the us need to pick and choose its battle    despite assad s human right abuse    our priority be no long to sit and focus on get assad out  
 the dead be wherever you look    inside syrian town after chemical attack read more that same day in turkey tillerson say assad s longerterm status will be decide by the syrian people  
 since the syrian people live in one of the world s bloodiest war zone besiege by assad s force and other observer understand tillerson and haley to say that the us be abandon barack obama s rhetorical commitment to assad s removal senator john mccain a hawk on syria call himself deeply disturb by tillerson and haley s position

  assad s role in the future be uncertain clearly with the act that he have take it would seem that there would be no role for he to govern the syrian people    he say ask if the us be prepared to diplomatically rally an international coalition to remove assad from power through what tillerson call a political process    tillerson respond    those step be under way  
 the missile that soon land on the shayrat airbase seem accordingly to mark the first salvo toward the us oust assad policy 3 the issue be chemical weapon use not assad 610 april 2017 hour after the missile strike the newly empower national security adviser hr mcmaster whose career be make by a different middle eastern war define the us attack in minimalist term    it be aim at the capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapon but it be not of a scope or a scale that it would go after all such related facility next to mcmaster tillerson say the chemical attack be particular ly heinous    over and above assad s brutality with conventional weapon notably absent from mcmaster s explanation of the strike be any indication of whether assad s removal be a us objective at all    the strike itself would not have affect assad s hold on power but if endanger that hold be once again a us goal it would have to be the first of many    instead mcmaster say the strike ought to prompt a big shift in assad s calculus against chemical weapon use assad s calculus however should not matter to the we if he be no long in power on 10 april the us defense secretary james mattis issue a statement similar to that of his ally mcmaster    the syrian government would be illadvise ever again to use chemical weapon but that be after several statement with different policy implication policy 4 attack isis first then assad can stay or go depend on whether russia agree 9 april 2017 tillerson make his first appearance on the sunday chatshow sound more like his 30 march self than his 6 april incarnation    our priority be first the defeat of isis    he say which in fairness he have also say on 6 april in what seem like a throwaway line once the us could conclude that war the we would attempt to broker ceasefire agreement between the syrian civil war s various combatant even though assad with russian support have violate ceasefire in the past tillerson say he be hopeful to work with russia and use their influence to achieve area of stabilization throughout syria and create the condition for a political process through geneva in which we can engage all of the party on a way forward  
 through that process apparently not yet under way    despite tillerson s 6 april statement the international community would decide the fate of bashar assad  
 nothing about tillerson s statement imply that assad s fate would be to leave power the area of stabilization in syria that russia have facilitate have prop assad up and russia have show no sign of abandon its client nor do tillerson define when the we would conclude its war against isis beyond that tillerson imply that overthrowing assad would be disastrous cite obama s adventurism in libya that topple muammar gaddafi    any time you go in and have a violent change at the top it be very difficult to create the condition for stability longerterm  
 but if tillerson be again prize stability over regime change haley be do the opposite haley reverse her own 30 march statement thoroughly say the we could have multiple priority in syria beyond defeat isis she agree with tillerson on the importance of the political solution    but fill in the blank on where the us want it to end up    in no way do we see peace in that area with assad as the head of the syrian government and we have to make sure that we re push that process the political solution have to come together for the good of the people of syria  
 the message to russia haley tell nbc be    we re not go to allow you to cover up for this regime anymore  
 mcmaster in an interview with fox news seem to back haley s vision of we diplomacy for syria all while place the onus for assad s fate on russia 
  it s very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the assad regime now we be not say that we be the one who be go to effect that change    mcmaster say say russia have to ask hard question about be we support this murderous regime that be commit mass murder of its own population and use the most heinous weapon available  
 muddy the water of tillerson s isisfirst approach mcmaster say    there have to be a degree of simultaneous activity as well as sequence of the defeat of isis first  
 ask why the us draw the line at chemical weapon rather than the barrel bomb assad s force have use to kill countless more syrian civilian haley reply    that s a decision for the president to make mcmaster ask the same question agree    the president will make whatever decision he think be in the good interest of the american people  
 policy 5 the we will respond militarily to barrel bomb 10 april sean spicer the white house press secretary on monday imply trump have make the decision to which haley and mcmaster allude now the us place barrel bomb along the continuum with chemical weapon since the us have respond to chemical weapon with tomahawk missile spicer s comment suggest an even deep us military engagement in syria unrelated to chemical weapon even as mcmaster have define the strike in a manner that suggest the us merely seek to establish a credible deterrent against future chemical weapon use 
  the sight of people be gas and blow away by barrel bomb ensure that if we see this kind of action again we hold open the possibility of future action    spicer say read from prepared presumably deliberate remark spicer follow criticism later say that he only mean to refer to barrel bomb that contain chlorine or other industrial chemical but that would still represent a substantial expansion of the us rule of engagement in syria the regime be suspect of use chlorine gas in its attack on at least 16 occasion since 2013 within hour mattis release a statement once again define the us objective minimally and with clarity atypical of the trump administration 
  the us military strike against shayrat airfield on april 6 be a measure response to the syrian government s use of chemical weapon    say mattis a veteran of two different iraq war and afghanistan

258,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/national-security-whistleblowing-inquiry-edward-snowden-analysis,"as a former pentagon official condemn whistleblowing system expert hope justice department effort do more than rearrange deck chair on the titanic former head of the cia david petraeus in an interview publish in the financial time on 6 may be ask if edward snowden should be prosecute    unquestionably    say petraeus snowden call for whistleblow shield after claim by new pentagon source read more leave aside the issue of hypocrisy petraeus share classified information with his lover and be not charge with a felony and instead think about what he say next    if snowden have want to help that debate he could have very easily be a whistleblower who could have go to the appropriate organization and offer his view he didn t  
 it be a line that have be repeat by barack obama hillary clinton and just about every other establishment figure ask about snowden rather than a leak to the medium they argue there be alternative route he could have take his concern to congress or pursue the official internal route through the inspector general s office but a powerful new insider account undermine the idea that the inspector general s office offer whistleblower a safe route john crane supervise the whistleblowerprotection unit of the pentagon inspector general which have oversight responsibility for defense department component such as the national security agency his story tell at length in mark hertsgaard s powerful new book braveheart whistleblowe in the age of snowden suggest that an office mean to aid whistleblowing can put whistleblower in danger this be someone who be deep inside the system who say the system fail much of the book deal with the case of thomas drake an nsa employee more senior than snowden who become concerned after 911 over warrantless surveillance and take his concern to the inspectorgeneral s office crane s suspicion be that instead of protect drake as his office should have do drake s identity be pass to the justice department what be need crane and his advocate argue be wholesale reform of the whistleblowing system to ensure that there be real protection in place at present there be no clarity different lawyer have different interpretation of what cover be provide by exist legislation such as the 1998 intelligence community whistleblower protection act there be also huge gap in the exist legislation contractor such as snowden be not cover by the same protection as fulltime staff the result of a legislative carveout at the behest of the intelligence agency that occur the year before snowden s disclosure the stake for an inquiry at the us justice department set to launch on 1 june be nothing less than the future of national security whistleblowing will it follow snowden s model or drake s 
  name one whistleblower from the intelligence community whose disclosure lead to real change overturn law end policy who didn t face retaliation as a result the protection just aren t there    snowden tell  
 many in we national security circle dismiss snowden as a traitor a spy or a stooge of the russians other have more nuance perspective some acknowledge that episode like drake s indicate the institutional deck be stack against an insider seek to warn of the danger to freedom represent by bulk surveillance carry out by the us intelligence apparatus and with the approval of the leadership of secret congressional committee oversee it but even many in that latter category be instinctually discomfit by public disclosure of classified information it be for they that the justice department inquiry matter most as it will prove a major step in determine whether nonpublic whistleblowing will be a viable or robust option crane who lose his career for defend drake be himself conflict about snowden 
  the fact that mr snowden go outside the system I think show a failure in the whistleblower protection program within the department of defense whistleblower need to have confidence that they can step forward without subsequently have reprisal and actually be put on trial    crane tell  
 crane want ultimately to make future snowden feel protect internally he hope that the us justice department inquiry will ultimately deter the edward snowden of the future that it will convince they that they be able to work within the system  
 there be those align with he even represent he who be skeptical that the inquiry set to unfold will yield those reform 
  I don t have a pollyannaish view of how it s go to right the system    say jesselyn radack a prominent whistleblower lawyer who represent crane before a different government panel the office of special counsel and who have also represent drake while radack s hope be that the inquiry vindicate crane and drake and prompt structural reform she say it may rearrange deck chair on the titanic but they continue to be so mess up  
 but another of crane s attorney the government accountability project s tom devine believe the inquiry be a step necessary to save a broken whistleblower system unlike many national security investigation much of its work will become public thank to the partnership of the federal office of special counsel which itself work to safeguard whistleblow right once the inquiry end probably next year the office will alert congress and the white house and post its work product online 
  it s a foundation for serious longterm effort for reform    say devine 
  instead of it be one person who accuse a major government institution of misconduct it s the official goodgovernment agency find a substantial likelihood of misconduct instead of a whistleblower be a lone voice there s now an official premise of wrongdoing on a massive scale here that seriously compromise the integrity of whistleblow right and the pentagon s response to illegal surveillance evidence  
 one of the route supposedly open to snowden would have be to go congress the problem with this be that the critical figure in congress already know about the scale of mass surveillance but do not do anything about it there be veil hint from some member uneasy about what they have learn but in the end they still do not act and it be leave to snowden to make his flight to hong kong

 if you be likely to be in close contact with someone infect a mask cut the chance of the disease be pass on if you re show symptom of coronavirus or have be diagnose wear a mask can also protect other so mask be crucial for health and social care worker look after patient and be also recommend for family member who need to care for someone who be ill ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask however mask will probably make little difference if you re just walk around town or take a bus so there be no need to bulkbuy a huge supply all virus accumulate mutation over time and the virus that cause covid19 be no different how widespread different strain of a virus become depend on natural selection the version that can propagate quick and replicate effectively in the body will be the most successful    this doesn t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though as virus that kill people rapidly or make they so sick that they be incapacitate may be less likely to be transmit genetic analysis by chinese scientist of 103 sample of the virus take from patient in wuhan and other city suggest that early on two main strain emerge designate l and s although the l strain appear to be more prevalent than the s strain about 70 of the sample belong to the former    the s branch of the virus be find to be the ancestral version the team behind this research suggest that this may indicate the l strain be more aggressive    either transmit more easily or replicate fast inside the body however this theory be speculative at this stage there haven t yet be direct comparison to see whether people who catch one version of the virus be more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptom many individual who get coronavirus will experience nothing bad than seasonal flu symptom but the overall profile of the disease include its mortality rate look more serious at the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild case be be miss but bruce aylward a who expert who lead an international mission to china to learn about the virus and the country s response say this have not be the case with covid19 the evidence do not suggest that we be only see the tip of the iceberg if bear out by further testing this could mean that current estimate of a roughly 1 fatality rate be accurate this would make covid19 about 10 time more deadly than seasonal flu which be estimate to kill between 290000 and 650000 people a year globally claim    it only kill the elderly so young people can relax most people who be not elderly and do not have underlie health condition will not become critically ill from covid19 but the illness still have a high chance of lead to serious respiratory symptom than seasonal flu and there be other atrisk group health worker for instance be more vulnerable because they be likely to have high exposure to the virus the action that young healthy people take include report symptom and follow quarantine instruction will have an important role in protect the most vulnerable in society and in shape the overall trajectory of the outbreak claim    you need to be with an infected person for 10 minute for flu some hospital guideline define exposure as be within six foot of an infected person who sneeze or cough for 10 minute or long however it be possible to be infect with short interaction or even by pick the virus up from contaminate surface although this be think to be a less common route of transmission claim    a vaccine could be ready within a few month scientist be quick out of the gate in begin development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus help by the early release of the genetic sequence by chinese researcher the development of a viable vaccine continue apace with several team now test candidate in animal experiment however the incremental trial require before a commercial vaccine could be roll out be still a lengthy undertaking and an essential one to ensure that even rare sideeffect be spot a commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick",theguardian,0

 bloomberg however have vow to stay in the race until a candidate win a majority of delegate need to clinch the nomination his campaign have spend heavily on advertising in state that vote on tuesday when a third of the available delegate that help select a democratic nominee be award in a single day and it s pin some of its hope on virginia the fourthbigg state at stake on tuesday and a key testing ground for bloomberg he make his first campaign visit here last november and have visit another six time since last week his campaign have hope he could win or come close after biden s win in south carolina the former vice president pick up endorsement from former virginia governor terry mcauliffe and virginia senator tim kaine the 2016 democratic vice presidential candidate underline how biden s comeback be draw establishment democrat who might have otherwise back bloomberg dan blue a prominent democrat in the north carolina state senate who endorse bloomberg last week say biden s strong showing in south carolina reset the race but he say he still believe that bloomberg can win by play the long game and gradually accumulate delegate 
  there s no question in my mind that this thing be very fluid and not absolute    he say bloomberg s heavy advertising spending however make he a uniquely powerful candidate even if he lag in opinion poll he have spend more than half a billion dollar on ad ahead of tuesday more than four time the combine ad spending of his four remain main rival sander biden senator elizabeth warren and senator amy klobuchar accord to datum from ad tracker advertising analytic the big chunk be spend in super tuesday states    214 million through feb 25 include more than 63 million in california and 50 million in texas where one analysis say 80 percent of the ad be bloomberg s already bloomberg have spend more on television ad than donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton do in their entire 2016 campaign 
  it s truly astonishing    say michael franz at bowdoin college in maine a lead researcher on political advertising many of his ad feature trump mock the president as a bully other introduce his life story when he draw criticism for sexist comment and past treatment of woman on the job one ad counter with endorsement from longtime woman employee the campaign also have push beyond old frontier with digital spending more than 106 million have be pour into google and facebook ad accord to disclosure by the social medium giant without a young network of enthusiast on social medium like the one enjoy by sander bloomberg have try to boost his online presence by pay for one he have hire influential meme account to post message on instagram and pay other 2500 a month to share probloomberg message on text and social medium inside his campaign headquarters in new york the staff of hawkfish a startup digital analytic company sift through huge tranche of voter datum to help chart his campaign strategy bloomberg decide hawkfish be necessary because democrats haven t keep up with trump s ability to target voter and bombard they with message say dan kanninen the campaign s state director    it s a very potent very difficulttoovercome weapon  
 his unprecedented spending have likely fuel his rise in public opinion poll from just around 5 when he enter the race on nov 24 to about 16 in recent poll 
  the question be how much can it buy he and there s definitely a ceiling    say amanda wintersieck a political science professor at virginia commonwealth university in richmond virginia in south carolina where he be not on the ballot but have still spend 23 million on advertising through feb 25 two third of the primary voter say they view bloomberg unfavorably accord to edison research exit poll about 77 and 51 of these voter have favorable view of biden and sander respectively the spending have also provide a target for opponent who say bloomberg be stark proof that the wealthy wield too much influence over us election in conversation with dozen of mostly democratic voter across seven state last week    find that bloomberg s spending blitz have win he a little enthusiasm and some respect paula abrams drive 100 mile through a snowstorm to attend a rally in an airplane hangar in blountville tennessee and plan to vote for he on tuesday    he seem like he care    say abrams 55 an educator in knoxville tennessee and joy west 62 a retire teacher say she think he s the only one who can beat trump    he really have the only chance of win this thing  
 other be less forgiving bloomberg have apologize for oversee an increase in the use of a police practice call stop and frisk in new york city that disproportionately affect black and other racial minority resident on sunday as bloomberg start to speak about racial inequality at a chapel in selma alabama one of the 14 super tuesday state about 10 people mostly black stand up and turn their back biden be seat in a place of honor with the pastor at the same church 
  I think it s just an insult for he to come here    say lisa brown who be black and a consultant who travel to selma from los angeles refer to bloomberg the incident underline bloomberg s continue struggle to win over black voter a core constituency for the democratic party bloomberg s supporter say they hope his spending will deliver dividend in battleground state that favor moderate like virginia where some poll put he ahead of biden but at a close second behind sander bloomberg make friend in virginia long before his campaign spend million to elect democrat to state office and congressional seat culminate with democrats take control of the state legislature last november last week those legislator give final approval to a sweeping set of gun control law a signature cause for bloomberg 
  I think people be appreciative    say lori haas virginia director of the coalition to stop gun violence and a bloomberg supporter bloomberg have open seven field office in the state part of a national network of office and pay staff that have far outpace his rival the campaign have more than 2000 pay worker and 214 office in 43 state not count the several hundred in his new york headquarters say kanninen the campaign s state director whatever happen on tuesday bloomberg and his campaign staffer have be stress that he will keep spend into the fall to defeat trump whether he s the candidate or not 
  someone say you shouldn t be spend all that money    bloomberg say on saturday at a getoutthevote rally aim at woman in mclean virginia    I say    yes well I m spend it to remove donald trump    and he say    well spend more   ",reuters,1

  he s not go to have a grinch moment I do not think with his heart grow two size large and we see he change his behavior    mcmaster tell fox news host bret bai at the reagan national defense forum bai interview mcmaster after he speak at the forum in its fifth year at the ronald reagan presidential library in simi valley calif on the prospect of a military showdown with pyongyang    it s increase every day which mean that we be in a race    mcmaster say 
  really we be in a race to be able to solve this problem not just we but the united states our ally and partner 
  we know china have tremendous coercive economic power over north korea    he add    you can not shoot a missile without fuel right 
  there be way to address this problem short of conflict but it be a race because he s get close and close and there s not much time leave  
 north korea successfully test a new intercontinental ballistic missile wednesday and kim declare that his country have achieve full nuclear statehood the white house immediately respond that the regime would be utterly destroy if its longrange nuclear missile arsenal effort provoke a military clash mcmaster tell bai that the trump administration be assess north korea s late launch    but what be clear be that every time he conduct a missile launch and nuclear test he get well 
  whether it s a success or failure be not as important as understand that over the year he s be learn from failure improve and thereby increase his threat to all of we  
 pyongyang s effort be far unite the us and its ally include china mcmaster say 
  china agree that this be a threat to everyone    he say    this be a global threat

 however despite the unease on the korean peninsula mcmaster say that americans can feel safe attend the winter olympic in south korea in february

 on russian sanction the national security adviser say that it take time to implement those congress approve in july because the administration want to make sure we be do it right 
  sanction be relevant to counter russia s destabilizing behavior and we be move on that as fast as we can  
 he note that the treasury department be also act to increase the economic isolation and pressure on the north korean regime 
  it s also go to sanction iran s behavior associate with their missile development in violation of un council resolution and to sanction behavior base on support for terrorist organization and their proxy 
  if you look at venezuela and the victimization of the venezuelan people we be do everything we can in support with our ally and partner to communicate to president nicolás maduro that he have to restore his citizen constitutional right and that have to do with sanction
